# Error Handling with iOS Files
An Xcode 9 playground written in Swift 4 code that explores Error Handling when manipulating the iOS file system.

The code in this playground is discussed in at least three of my tutorials: **1)** ["iOS file management with FileManager in protocol-oriented Swift 4"](http://iosbrain.com/blog/2018/04/22/ios-file-management-with-filemanager-in-protocol-oriented-swift-4/), **2)** ["Controlling chaos: Why you should care about adding error checking to your iOS apps"](http://iosbrain.com/blog/2018/04/29/controlling-chaos-why-you-should-care-about-adding-error-checking-to-your-ios-apps/), and **especially** in **3)** ["Controlling chaos: Error Handling in Swift 4 with do, try, catch, defer, throw, throws, Error, and NSError"](http://iosbrain.com/blog/2018/05/01/controlling-chaos-error-handling-in-swift-4-with-do-try-catch-defer-throw-throws-error-and-nserror/).

By reading and running this code, and reading the accompanying tutorials, you will gain insight and experience in several core software development concepts. 

For example, I'll show you how you can successfully write maintainable, reusable, and extensible code using Swift protocol-oriented programming or "POP" (read my articles on [protocols](http://iosbrain.com/blog/2018/01/20/understanding-swift-4-protocols-and-using-them-in-your-apps/), an [introduction to POP](http://iosbrain.com/blog/2018/03/21/protocol-oriented-programming-in-swift-an-introduction/), using [advanced POP](http://iosbrain.com/blog/2018/03/28/protocol-oriented-programming-in-swift-is-it-better-than-object-oriented-programming/), and [value semantics](http://iosbrain.com/blog/2018/03/28/protocol-oriented-programming-in-swift-is-it-better-than-object-oriented-programming/#value_semantics)).

I'll teach you how to [read, write, delete, rename, and move files](http://iosbrain.com/blog/2018/04/22/ios-file-management-with-filemanager-in-protocol-oriented-swift-4/) in a iOS sandboxed app.

I'll demonstrate how you [handle errors](http://iosbrain.com/blog/2018/05/01/controlling-chaos-error-handling-in-swift-4-with-do-try-catch-defer-throw-throws-error-and-nserror/) while working with the iOS file system.
